- `OnDeinit(const int reason)`: This function is called during the expert advisor's deinitialization. Any necessary deinitialization code can be added here.

### Main Trading Functions

- `OnTick()`: This function is called on every tick of the price. It checks for breakout of support or resistance levels and opens trades accordingly.

- `IsBreakoutSupportLevel()`: This function checks for a breakout of the support level. It analyzes daily support levels and returns `true` if the breakout condition is met.

- `IsBreakoutResistanceLevel()`: This function checks for a breakout of the resistance level. It analyzes daily resistance levels and returns `true` if the breakout condition is met.

The take profit and stop loss levels are set based on the user-defined input parameters. The expert advisor also includes functions to handle volatile market conditions, display trade information, and provide documentation.
